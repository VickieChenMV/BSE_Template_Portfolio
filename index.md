# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and connecting the Raspberry Pi with my computer with VNC Viewer for more effecient coding. I downloaded the MAC OS on my SD card and uploaded to the Raspberry Pi LCD monitor. I connected my keyboard and mouse wirelessly to the monitor, then downloaded VNC Viewer on my MacBook to connect to my monitor. All my coding is done on my Mac since it's much easier. Another part of my first milestone was being able to finally send out a tweet on my account using Raspberry Pi. There was a 401 autorization error that took me a few days to fix, but now my Twitter bot can tweet using just command lines.
